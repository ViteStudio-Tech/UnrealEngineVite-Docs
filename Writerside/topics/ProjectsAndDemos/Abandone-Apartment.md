Interior lighting scene. Interiors are the hardest case for global illumination, which makes them the most
useful place to evaluate it.

*Almost every surface visible here is lit by bounce rather than by the sun directly. That is what makes
interiors the honest test of a GI solution.*

## Why interiors

An interior is almost entirely indirect light. Sun enters through a small number of openings and everything
else the eye sees is bounce. Get the GI wrong and the scene reads as flat or as leaking; there is no
direct lighting to hide behind.

That makes scenes like this the right place to evaluate the practical differences between Vite's GI
options:

| Approach | Behaviour in an interior |
|---|---|
| [Static DDGI](DDGI-Static.md) | Baked probe data. Cheapest, and correct if nothing moves. |
| [Dynamic DDGI](DDGI-Dynamic.md) | Probes update at runtime. Handles time of day and moving occluders. |
| [SSGI](SSGI.md) | Adds contact-scale detail the probe grid cannot resolve |
| Per-pixel ray-traced GI | Reference quality, unaffordable at frame rate, and compiled out by default |

The realistic answer for most interiors is DDGI plus SSGI. DDGI supplies the low-frequency bounce and SSGI
fills in the detail near contacts and in corners. See
[Global Illumination](Global-Illumination.md).

## What to look at

- **Light leaking.** Probe-based GI leaks through thin geometry when probe spacing is too coarse relative
  to wall thickness. Interiors are full of thin walls, so this is where to tune probe density.
- **Corner darkening.** Compare DDGI alone against DDGI with SSGI enabled. The difference concentrates in
  corners and at contacts.
- **Ambient occlusion choice.** [HBAO+ versus the optimised SSAO path](Ambient-Occlusion.md) is most
  visible in cluttered interiors.
- **Ray-traced reflections.** Interior surfaces reflect a great deal of off-screen geometry, which is
  exactly the case screen-space reflections cannot handle.
