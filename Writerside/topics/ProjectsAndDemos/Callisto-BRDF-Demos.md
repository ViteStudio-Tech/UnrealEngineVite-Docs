# Callisto BRDF Demos

Two character scenes demonstrating Vite's custom Callisto BRDF shading model, which repurposes standard
material pins for retroreflection, diffuse Fresnel and terminator control.

## What Callisto BRDF does

Unreal's default lit model is a good general-purpose BRDF and a mediocre skin and character model. Callisto
BRDF is a Vite addition that gives you direct control over the terms that matter for character rendering,
by repurposing existing material pins rather than adding new ones:

| Standard pin | Becomes |
|---|---|
| Opacity | Retroreflection |
| Anisotropy | Diffuse Fresnel |
| Custom Data 0 | Smooth Terminator |
| Custom Data 1 | Diffuse Fresnel Falloff |
| Ambient Occlusion | Retroreflection Falloff |

Smooth Terminator is the one to look at first. The hard shadow terminator on curved surfaces is one of the
most obvious tells of a real-time character, and controlling it directly is cheaper and more predictable
than working around it with normal map or lighting tricks.

Full pin reference and authoring notes in [Shading Models](Shading-Models.md).

## Using the demos

Open the character material and change one pin at a time. The remapped pins interact, and the effect of
each is much clearer in isolation than in the shipped combination.

Pay attention to how the model responds to grazing light. Retroreflection and diffuse Fresnel both act
strongest there, and that is where the difference from the default lit model is most visible.

## Porting the setup

The material graph is the useful part of these demos. Callisto BRDF is a shading model selection, so
adopting it is a matter of switching the model and rewiring the affected pins &mdash; there is no plugin to
enable and no compile-time switch involved.

<note>
Each additional shading model in use adds shader permutations. If you only need Callisto on characters,
use it only on characters. See
<a href="Shader-Compilation-And-PSO.md">Shader Compilation and PSO</a>.
