# Tech Demo Project

<tldr>
<p>
Vite's main showcase package. Four scenes covering dynamic global illumination, Apex Destruction and Apex
Cloth. The reference project for verifying that a build works correctly.

*The Tech Demo package is the reference project for verifying that a fresh build renders and simulates
correctly.*

## Contents

| Scene | Demonstrates |
|---|---|
| NVIDIA DDGI Cornell Box office sample | [Dynamic DDGI](DDGI-Dynamic.md) in a controlled reference setting |
| PhysX Apex Destruction test bed | [Apex Destruction](Destruction-And-Cloth.md) |
| PhysX Apex Cloth sample | [Apex Cloth](Destruction-And-Cloth.md) |
| "High End" DDGI + SSGI Deep Elder Caves | [DDGI](DDGI-Dynamic.md) combined with [SSGI](SSGI.md) in production-scale content |

The Cornell Box is the useful one for understanding DDGI. It is the standard global illumination reference
scene precisely because the correct answer is known, so probe placement, leaking and response time are all
visible against a ground truth.

The Deep Elder Caves scene is the opposite case: production-scale geometry where DDGI and SSGI are layered.
DDGI supplies the low-frequency bounce and SSGI adds the contact-scale detail DDGI's probe grid cannot
resolve. See [Global Illumination](Global-Illumination.md) for why both are used together.

## Using it as a verification project

Vite's [contribution guidelines](Coding-Guidelines.md) name this project specifically: engine changes must
produce no crashes on startup, shutdown or on the Tech Showcase project. If you are modifying the engine,
run this before opening a pull request.

It exercises a useful cross-section: dynamic GI, ray tracing, PhysX destruction and cloth. A change that
breaks any of those tends to break it here.

## Requirements

Dynamic DDGI requires a DXR-capable GPU on DirectX 12. Apex Destruction and Apex Cloth require their
plugins, which are stock 4.27 plugins Vite retains. See [Platforms](Platforms.md) and
[System Requirements](System-Requirements.md).
