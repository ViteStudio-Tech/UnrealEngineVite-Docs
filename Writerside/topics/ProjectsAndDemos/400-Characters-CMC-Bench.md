## What it measures

The Character Movement Component is one of the most expensive stock Unreal components per instance. Every
moving character runs collision sweeps, floor checks, root motion evaluation and network-prediction
bookkeeping every tick, on the game thread.

At one character it is invisible. At 400 it is often the entire frame budget, and it is the reason so many
projects hit a game thread wall long before their GPU is saturated.

This benchmark exists to make that cost measurable rather than theoretical.

## Running it

Enable `stat unit` and watch **Game** rather than **Frame**. If Game is the largest number, you are
CPU-bound on the game thread and no amount of rendering optimisation will help.

Then narrow it down:

| Command | Shows |
|---|---|
| `stat game` | Game thread breakdown by category |
| `stat character` | Character movement specifics |
| `stat anim` | Animation evaluation cost, usually the second contributor |
| `stat physics` | Collision query cost from movement sweeps |

See [Profiling](Profiling.md).

## Why it matters for Vite

Game thread cost is where UE 4.27 has a structural advantage over UE5, and it is central to
[Vite's rationale](Why-NvRTX-427.md). The base cost of core classes, the tick pipeline and the movement
component are all lighter in 4.27, and Vite trims them further &mdash; see
[Engine Defaults](Engine-Defaults.md) for the specific changes.

The relevant comparison numbers are in
[UE4 versus UE5 Cost Analysis](UE4-Versus-UE5-Cost-Analysis.md).

## Reducing CMC cost in your own project

If this benchmark's shape matches your bottleneck:

- **Tick less.** Distant or off-screen characters do not need full-rate movement. Significance Manager and
  tick interval both apply.
- **Simplify collision.** Movement sweeps cost in proportion to collision complexity.
- **Budget animation.** The Animation Budget Allocator plugin is stock 4.27 and directly targets this.
- **Consider not using CMC.** For crowds that do not need networked prediction, a simpler custom movement
  path avoids most of the cost.
- **Consider ECS.** For very large entity counts, the bundled [Flecs ECS](Bundled-Plugins.md) integration
  sidesteps actor-per-entity overhead entirely.
