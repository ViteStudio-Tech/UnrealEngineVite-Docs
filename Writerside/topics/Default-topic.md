# Unreal Engine Vite Manual

<tldr>
<p>
Unreal Engine Vite is a performance-first fork of Unreal Engine 4.27 built from the NvRTX and Plus branches.
It keeps PhysX, adds DDGI, RTXDI, tessellation, SMAA and HBAO+, and targets native-resolution,
high-frame-rate rendering on console-class hardware.

Welcome to the Unreal Engine Vite manual. This site documents the engine fork itself: how to build it,
what it changes relative to stock Unreal Engine 4.27, which rendering and physics systems it adds, and
how to get a project shipping on it.

Vite is aimed at teams in active production. It is not a research branch or a Tech demonstration. Every feature
documented here is expected to survive cooking, packaging and shipping on real hardware, and the
manual is written with that assumption throughout.

*The stylized demo, lit entirely by dynamic ray-traced global illumination: 811 FPS at 1440p native on an
RTX 4080 Super. The same scene on Lumen in Unreal Engine 5.7 measures 324 FPS.*

## What Vite is for

Unreal Engine 5.7 and 5.8 target roughly 60 FPS at dynamic internal resolutions of 720p&ndash;1080p on
PlayStation 5 using Lumen, Nanite, Virtual Shadow Maps, TSR and Chaos. That stack buys its fidelity with
virtualisation and temporal reconstruction, and pays for it in processing, streaming and memory overhead,
in noise, ghosting and blur, and in a renderer whose base cost is high before a project has built anything.

With the Nintendo Switch 2 shipping, handhelds like the Steam Deck established, and hardware costs rising,
that trade increasingly does not match the machines games have to run on. Vite takes the opposite position:
hold high visual fidelity while keeping strict frame-time budgets and high native resolutions.

The concrete claim is a base performance uplift of up to 2.5x real game FPS against UE 5.7's intended
feature set, and it is backed by measurements rather than assertion &mdash; see
[UE4 versus UE5 Cost Analysis](UE4-Versus-UE5-Cost-Analysis.md) and
[Projects and Demos](ProjectsAndDemos.md).

## The features Vite is built around

<deflist>
<def title="Dynamic DDGI">
Ray-traced irradiance probe volumes. Noise-free by construction, fully dynamic, and roughly twice the frame
rate of hardware Lumen in comparable scenes. See <a href="DDGI-Dynamic.md">Dynamic DDGI</a>.
</def>
<def title="Static DDGI">
The same probe representation with near-instant bake times. Higher bounce fidelity than traditional baked
lighting and better coverage of moving objects. Viable on GPUs with no ray tracing support at all. See
<a href="DDGI-Static.md">Static DDGI</a>.
</def>
<def title="Optimised RT reflections">
Capable of 4K native 60 FPS on a PS5-class GPU. With DDGI active, reflection rays sample probe irradiance
for their secondary bounce rather than returning black. See
<a href="RT-Reflections.md">Ray-Traced Reflections</a>.
</def>
<def title="UE4-era SSGI">
SSGI regressed in quality and performance when UE5 folded it into Lumen, and can no longer run alongside a
separate GI solution. In Vite it composes cleanly with DDGI. See <a href="SSGI.md">SSGI</a>.
</def>
<def title="PhysX 3.4">
Libraries rebuilt for newer Clang versions, Blast support added, and GPU-accelerated particles that run
across vendors. Measurably faster than Chaos on the same workload. See <a href="PhysX.md">PhysX</a>.
</def>
<def title="Apex Destruction and Cloth">
Both were deprecated and then removed in UE5 with no migration path for existing assets. In Vite they keep
working. See <a href="Destruction-And-Cloth.md">Destruction and Cloth</a>.
</def>
<def title="RTXDI">
A less noisy alternative to MegaLights, in its standalone form rather than the Lumen-integrated version
found in 5.1 and later. See <a href="RTXDI.md">RTXDI</a>.
</def>
<def title="Tessellation">
Distance- and displacement-driven geometric detail: smoother surfaces, better silhouettes and
high-frequency detail at runtime without Nanite's overhead. See <a href="Tessellation.md">Tessellation</a>.
</def>
</deflist>

## Performance targets

Every target below includes ray tracing. Full detail and measurement conditions in
[Performance Targets](Performance-Targets.md).

| PS5-class target | What it includes |
|---|---|
| **Stylized, 4K 120 FPS** | RT DDGI, as shown in the Stylized demo. Intended for competitive multiplayer. |
| **Performance, high end, 4K 60 FPS** | DDGI, RT reflections and tessellation, as shown in the Unreal Tournament Vite demo. |
| **Fidelity, high end, 4K 30 FPS** | The same stack scaled for large open worlds with high geometric density. |
| **Fidelity, full RT, 1440p 30 FPS** | Adds RTAO and RT shadows on top of DDGI and RT reflections. |
