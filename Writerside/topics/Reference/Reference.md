## Quick answers

<deflist>
<def title="A console variable I set does nothing">
Most likely the feature is compiled out. <code>VITE_RT_PSO_DEBLOAT</code> defaults to <code>1</code> and
removes the shader permutations for RTXDI, path tracing, ray-traced translucency, caustics and per-pixel
ray-traced GI. The variables still set; nothing renders. See
<a href="Compile-Time-Switches.md">Compile-Time Switches</a>.
</def>
<def title="A feature is missing from the editor">
Check whether its plugin is enabled. Most bundled plugins default to off &mdash; see
<a href="Bundled-Plugins.md">Bundled Plugins</a>.
</def>
<def title="The build fails on a fresh clone">
Usually a toolchain mismatch or missing .NET Framework 4.5 reference assemblies. See
<a href="Build-Troubleshooting.md">Build Troubleshooting</a>.
</def>
<def title="Shaders behave as though my change did not happen">
Stale cache. See <a href="Cache-Management.md">Cache Management</a>.
