# Physics

<tldr>
<p>
Vite's physics stack uses <b>PhysX 3.4</b>, with Vite extensions for fixed-timestep simulation,
modern toolchains, NVIDIA Blast and high-count instanced rigid bodies. This page describes the physics
architecture and its measured CPU behavior; the <a href="PhysX.md">PhysX page</a> documents backend features.

</tldr>

Vite treats physics as a frame-time-critical engine system. Simulation cost includes more than the solver:
broad phase, contact generation, island construction, constraint preparation, iterative solving, integration,
callbacks and synchronization with engine state all contribute to the final physics time.

## Physics CPU architecture

### Threading and the critical path

PhysX and Chaos both support multithreaded simulation. Chaos can execute through the Task Graph, use a
dedicated physics thread and parallelize selected particle, collision and island work. A dedicated thread
moves work away from the game thread, but it does not by itself reduce the time between starting and
finishing a simulation step.

Physics contains ordered phases and data dependencies. Constraints within a connected island cannot all be
solved independently, and later stages must wait for the state produced by earlier stages. Scaling therefore
depends on the number and size of independent islands, task granularity, synchronization frequency and the
amount of state transferred between the game and physics representations.

PhysX 3.4 exposes a dependency-linked `TaskManager` and `CpuDispatcher`. Simulation stages create
`LightCpuTask` jobs and submit them to the engine worker pool as their prerequisites complete. Vite's Unreal
integration can batch dispatcher submissions to trade scheduling overhead against available parallelism.
NVIDIA's [PhysX 3.4 threading documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/gameworks/content/gameworkslibrary/physx/guide/Manual/Threading.html?highlight=cpudispatcher)


### SIMD coverage

Chaos contains optional Intel ISPC kernels. ISPC is a SIMD technology: it compiles an SPMD program for the
vector units of the target CPU. The relevant constraint is coverage and utilization, not "ISPC versus SIMD."
Only work implemented by an ISPC kernel receives that vector path. Divergent contacts, indirect memory
access, gathers and scatters, heterogeneous constraint types and pointer-heavy data reduce effective lane
occupancy. Intel's [ISPC documentation](https://ispc.github.io/index.html) describes the compiler and its SIMD
execution model.

PhysX's narrow phase and solver were developed around batched float data and platform SIMD kernels. The
useful measurement is effective vector occupancy across the complete simulation step, including work that
remains scalar or loses time to data movement.

### Numeric precision

UE5 Large World Coordinates changed core world-space types to double precision. Epic's
[LWC documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/unreal-engine/large-world-coordinates-in-unreal-engine-5)
explicitly documents double precision in Chaos destruction. This does not mean that every field in every
Chaos subsystem is FP64. Modern Chaos uses mixed precision in selected paths, while the experimental Chaos
implementation in the UE4.27 base aliases its primary `FReal` to `float`.

Double precision remains SIMD-capable. A fixed-width register, however, carries half as many doubles as
floats: a 256-bit register holds four 64-bit values or eight 32-bit values. Double-based fields also require
twice the storage and memory bandwidth of equivalent float fields. In affected kernels this can reduce
theoretical element throughput, increase cache pressure and add conversion work at float/double boundaries.
Epic's [LWC conversion guide](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/unreal-engine/large-world-coordinates-project-conversion-guidelines-in-unreal-engine-5)
documents both `VectorRegister4f` and `VectorRegister4d`; the constraint is lane width and data cost, not an
absence of vector instructions.

There is no accurate universal percentage for the FP64 cost. Scalar FP32 and FP64 instructions can have
similar latency on some CPUs, while vector-throughput- or bandwidth-bound kernels can experience a much
larger difference. Any percentage must be attached to a named workload, platform and build.

## Box Container Pile 10K benchmark

The supplied reports measure a deliberately physics-bound pile containing **10,005 active rigid bodies and
10,005 shapes**. Rendering is removed(except for Chaos), sleeping is disabled and both runs use four solver iterations, a
60 Hz simulation step, 30 warm-up steps and 300 measured steps. The metric is median physics milliseconds
per frame; lower is better. 

<note>
This is purely a performance test; simulation precision and SDK features should be evaluated separately.

### Matching thread-count results

| Reported threads | Unreal Chaos | NVIDIA PhysX 3.4 | Vite PhysX 3.4 | Chaos / Vite | NVIDIA / Vite |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 1,052.09 ms | 49.61 ms | 35.60 ms | **29.55×** | **1.39×** |
| 3 | 1,051.41 ms | 21.98 ms | 15.95 ms | **65.92×** | **1.38×** |
| 4 | 951.36 ms | 18.94 ms | 14.17 ms | **67.14×** | **1.34×** |
| 5 | 857.89 ms | 17.09 ms | 12.47 ms | **68.80×** | **1.37×** |
| 6 | 791.97 ms | 15.82 ms | 11.76 ms | **67.34×** | **1.35×** |

<note>
Chaos had to be benched through Win64, not Headless as the rest of the SDKs.
</note>

Vite PhysX improves from 35.60 ms at one reported thread to 11.76 ms at six, a **3.03× throughput
increase**. NVIDIA PhysX 3.4 improves from 49.61 ms to 15.82 ms, a **3.14× increase**, while Chaos improves
from 1,052.09 ms to 791.97 ms over the same range, a **1.33× increase**. The Chaos report continues to 24
threads and reaches 581.25 ms, **1.81× the throughput of its one-thread result**.

At matching thread counts, Chaos takes **21.21× as long as stock NVIDIA PhysX at one thread** and **50.06×
as long at six threads**. NVIDIA PhysX takes 1.34–1.39× as long as Vite PhysX across the shared thread counts;
equivalently, Vite reduces the reported median physics time by **25.2–28.2%** relative to the NVIDIA PhysX
3.4 baseline. Vite PhysX enters the 16.67 ms budget for 60 Hz at three threads, and NVIDIA PhysX enters it at
six. The reported Chaos result remains outside that budget at 24 threads.

The one-thread result shows that task scaling cannot explain the complete gap: the reported physics time is
already 29.55× as long for Chaos as for Vite PhysX and 21.21× as long for Chaos as for NVIDIA PhysX before
additional worker scaling. The multi-thread results show that scaling widens a difference that also includes
solver work, data access, collision and constraint processing, build configuration and engine integration.
The stock NVIDIA result also separates the base PhysX architecture from the additional improvements in
Vite's PhysX build.

<note>
The reports use the same host and high-level workload settings, but not identical executables: Chaos is a Win64 Shipping
Chaos Program target, NVIDIA PhysX is a Visual Studio 2026 MSBuild Release SDK runner, and Vite PhysX is a
clang-cl 22 Release runtime build (Chaos had to be tested as Win64 due to it not being able to be compiled independently of UE5). Cite these values as the <b>reported Box Container Pile 10K result</b>, not as a
universal PhysX-versus-Chaos multiplier.
</note>

## Reproducing the comparison

For a controlled engine decision:

1. Pin both engine and benchmark-project commits.
2. Use equivalent compiler optimization, checks, logging and instrumentation.
3. Match collision shapes, material settings, solver iterations, sleeping, timestep and event generation.
4. Record thread affinity and P-core/E-core placement on hybrid CPUs.
5. Publish raw frame samples, median, percentiles and variance.
6. Capture the solver critical path and worker utilization with the appropriate CPU profiler.
7. Repeat with a representative production scene; a fully awake 10,005-body pile is a stress workload.

## In-engine cube workload

The [Vite PhysX Cube Test](https://github.com/ViteStudio-Tech/Vite-PhysX-Cube-Test) complements the headless
solver report with a workload that runs inside Unreal Engine. The public
[cube-spawner implementation](https://github.com/ViteStudio-Tech/Vite-PhysX-Cube-Test/blob/5ae89c3b7b9d6993fdc535a54769e39ca7a116b4/Source/PhysXTest/CubeSpawner.cpp)
creates one `UStaticMeshComponent` per cube, registers it with the engine and enables simulation through
`SetSimulatePhysics(true)`. The spawner itself is a single `AActor`, so this measures an engine-managed
component path rather than 3,000 separately spawned Unreal Actors.

### 3,000 engine-managed cubes

The matched capture reports 3,000 spawned cubes and 3,016 rendered primitives in both engine variants.
Unlike the Box Container Pile 10K runner, these values include the surrounding Unreal runtime work and are
not physics-solver milliseconds in isolation.

| Reported metric | Unreal 5.7 — Chaos | Unreal Vite 26 — PhysX 3.4 | Vite relative result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Spawned cubes | 3,000 | 3,000 | Matched |
| Rendered primitives | 3,016 | 3,016 | Matched |
| FPS | 33.26 | 157.88 | **4.75× as high** |
| Frame time | 30.07 ms | 6.33 ms | **78.9% lower** |
| Game time | 30.01 ms | 6.11 ms | **79.6% lower** |


The captured Chaos game time is **4.91×** the Vite PhysX game time, while its frame time is **4.75×** the
Vite PhysX frame time. Game time accounts for almost the complete frame in both captures, so the result is
CPU-side rather than a GPU-limited comparison.

*In-engine 3,000-cube capture. Both sides report 3,016 rendered primitives.*


### 1,425 native PhysX actors

The native-path capture represents simulated cubes directly as PhysX actors instead of giving every body a
separate Unreal `AActor`. This removes the per-body Unreal Actor lifecycle from the simulation representation
while the scene continues to run and render inside Unreal Engine. Any remaining render representation and
transform-bridge cost depends on the native integration.

| Reported metric | Native PhysX actor path |
|---|------------------------:|
| Engine label |     UE Vite  — PxActors |
| Spawned cubes |                   1,425 |
| Rendered primitives |                   1,447 |
| FPS |                  374.28 |
| Frame time |                 2.67 ms |
| Game time |                 2.11 ms |

<img src="NativePhysXActors1425.png" alt="In-engine Vite native PhysX actor test with 1,425 simulated cubes" border-effect="line"/>

*Native PhysX actor capture running in Unreal Engine without a separate UE Actor representation for each
simulated cube.*

<warning>
Do not calculate a direct multiplier between the native-path capture and the 3,000-cube comparison. The
native result uses 1,425 cubes, a different engine label and a different object representation. It documents
the lower-overhead native integration path; it is not a matched Chaos-versus-PhysX result.
</warning>

## Practical starting points

<procedure title="Set up physics for a new project" id="physics-setup">

        Review the <a href="PhysX.md">PhysX feature and configuration reference</a>.
    </step>
    <step>
        Configure substepping under <b>Project Settings &gt; Engine &gt; Physics</b> when fast-moving or heavily

    </step>
    <step>
        PhysX behaves best with a consistent frame rate. At very high or uneven frame rates, stuttering can 
        occur, so cap the FPS for steadier frame pacing. Setting MaxDepenetrationVelocity to around 100 can 
        also help reduce stutter caused by uneven frame pacing.
